    "#### Description of dataset\n",
    "My dataset contains information on tobacco use in the US by state or territory (hereafter, 'jurisdiction'), during the period 1995-2010. For a given year and jurisdiction, a number is given for each of the following four criteria, representing a percentage of the jurisdiction's total population for that year: (i) smoke everyday; (ii) smoke some days; (iii) former smoker; and (iv) never smoked.\n",
    "#### URL of dataset and download instructions\n",
    "The dataset's URL is [https://data.cdc.gov/Smoking-Tobacco-Use/BRFSS-Prevalence-and-Trends-Data-Tobacco-Use-Four-/8zak-ewtm]. For some reason, the link breaks, but the dataset can easily be found by searching for \"tobacco use\" in the search tool on the upper right-hand corner of the linked page. Once you navigate to the dataset's main page, it can be downloaded by clicking on the Export button on the top right-hand corner of the page, and clicking CSV. I have downloaded it as the file\n",
    "US-Smoking-data_1995-2010.csv and stored it in ./data.\n",
    "#### Two interesting Questions\n",
    "1. How have the percentages for the four types of tobacco use fluctuated for Washington State from 1995-2010?\n",
    "2. How have the percentages of people who smoke every day fluctuated for California, Texas, Florida, and New York (the four most populous states as of 2021)?"

However, the data also shows that the percentage of people that smoke some days remained steady, and even rose on some years, despite the percentage of people that smoke every day dramatically falling. Perhaps this can be attributed to people who smoked every day trying to quit or at least reduce their tobacco usage.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Smoked Every Day, 1995-2010:</b> The data shows that, at least with respect to the four states that were plotted, that the percentage of people that smoked every day in California started from a significantly lower point than the other three states. Regardless, the rate of decline of every-day smokers in California appear to be similar to the other three states.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>National Percentages of People that Never Smoked, 1995-2010:</b> The median is slightly lower than the average, which suggests that some states have increased the percentage of people that never smoked at a higher rate than other states. Further, there is a dramatic spike in 2003. Perhaps this suggests that a population came of age in 2003 that </li>\n",
